Blueprints and Specs
====================

The Neutron team uses the `neutron-specs
<http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/neutron-specs>`_ repository for it's
specification reviews. Detailed information can be found `here
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Blueprints#Neutron>`_. Please also find
additional information in the reviews.rst file.

The Neutron team does not enforce deadlines for specs and blueprints. These
can be submitted throughout the release cycle. The drivers team will review
this on a regular basis throughout the release, and based on the load for the
milestones, will assign these into milestones or move them to the backlog
for selection into a future release.

Please note that we use a `template
<http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/neutron-specs/tree/specs/template.rst>`_
for spec submissions. It is not required to fill out all sections in the
template. Review of the spec may require filling in information left out by
the submitter.

Neutron BP and Spec Notes
-------------------------

There are occasions when a spec will be approved and the code will not land in
the cycle it was targeted at. For these cases, the work flow to get the spec
into the next release is as follows:

* The PTL will create a <release>-backlog directory during the RC window and
  move all specs which didn't make the <release> there.
* Anyone can propose a patch to neutron-specs which moves a spec from the
  previous release into the new release directory.

The specs which are moved in this way can be fast-tracked into the next
release. Please note that it is required to re-propose the spec for the new
release however.

Neutron Feature Requests
------------------------

We are introducing the concept of feature requests. Feature requests are
tracked as Launchpad bugs, tagged with the new 'RFE' tag, and allow for
the submission and review of these feature requests before code is submitted.
This allows the team to verify the validity of a feature request before the
process of submitting a neutron-spec is undertaken, or code is written.  It
also allows the community to express interest in a feature by subscribing to
the bug and posting a comment in Launchpad. Note the temptation to game the
system exists, but given the history in Neutron for this type of activity, it
will not be tolerated and will be called out as such in public on the mailing
list.

RFEs can be submitted by anyone and by having the community vote on them in
Launchpad, we can gauge interest in features. The drivers team will evaluate
these on a weekly basis along with the specs.

The process for moving work from RFEs into the code involves someone assigning
themselves the RFE bug and filing a matching spec in the neutron-specs
repository. The spec will then be reviewed by the community and approved by
the drivers team before landing in a release. This is the same process as
before RFFs existed in Neutron.
